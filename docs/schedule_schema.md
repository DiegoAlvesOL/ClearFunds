## üîê Security Consideration

This system simulates part of a real-world payment processing environment. In actual implementations, **compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** is essential to ensure secure handling of cardholder data.

While this project **does not store or process full card data**, it's important to understand that:

- Real systems **must not** store full PAN or sensitive authentication data.
- Card BINs (first 6 digits) can be used for analytics or routing but **should be handled securely**.
- Logging or exposing any trace of card data must follow **PCI-compliant practices**.
